# Flowerbed Server Functions

Individual Amazon AWS Lambda functions used to make a REST API for Project Flowerbed to create, load, and save gardens on the cloud, using a MySQL database for storage.

These are currently unused, and not guaranteed to function. They are included for reference purposes only.

See `src/ServerConfigs.js` for a reference to the URLs that these functions should map to, and `src/js/lib/StorageInterface.js` for how they can be used.
