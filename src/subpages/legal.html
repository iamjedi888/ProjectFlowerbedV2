				Project Flowerbed Supplemental Terms of Service
			</h3>
			<p>Last Updated: September 23, 2022</p>

			<p>
				Project Flowerbed (including any services, information, content or other
				materials made available on or through Project Flowerbed, the “Service”)
				is provided to you by Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta”). By accepting these
				Project Flowerbed Supplemental Terms of Service (these “Supplemental
				Terms”) or using the Service, you agree to be bound by the Meta Terms of
				Service (available at
				<a
					target="_blank"
					rel="noopener noreferrer"
					href="https://www.facebook.com/terms.php"
					>https://www.facebook.com/terms.php</a
				>) (as may be updated from time to time, the “Terms of Service”), and
				these Supplemental Terms of Service (these “Supplemental Terms”), which
				together form an Agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and Meta. In
				the event of any express conflict between the Meta Terms of Service and
				these Supplemental Terms, the Meta Terms of Service will govern solely
				to the extent of the conflict.
			</p>
			<p>
				ARBITRATION NOTICE: IF YOU RESIDE IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU AGREE THAT
				ANY DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND META ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE
				SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS OR THE SERVICE WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING,
				INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO
				PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION, AS
				FURTHER SET FORTH IN SECTION 13 BELOW. META EXPLAINS SOME EXCEPTIONS AND
				HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION IN SECTION 13.
			</p>
			<p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Meta may change these Supplemental Terms from time to time by posting
					an updated Supplemental Terms. Any such changes will not apply to any
					dispute between you and Meta arising prior to the date on which Meta
					posted the updated Supplemental Terms incorporating such changes, or
					otherwise notified you of such changes. Your use of the Service
					following any changes to these Supplemental Terms will constitute your
					acceptance of such changes. The “Last Updated” legend above indicates
					when these Terms were last changed.
				</li>
				<li>
					By using the Service, you represent that you are 13 years of age or
					older. Any use of the Service by anyone under the age of 13 is
					unauthorized, unlicensed and in violation of these Supplemental Terms.
					You certify that you are of the legal age of majority in the
					jurisdiction in which you reside or, if you are between the ages of 13
					and the legal age of majority, that you are using the Service with the
					supervision of your parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by
					the Supplemental Terms, and that you have reviewed the Supplemental
					Terms with your parent or guardian so that you both understand all of
					your rights and obligations. Further, if you are accessing or using
					the Service on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any corporation,
					organization, partnership or other entity with which you are
					associated (“Entity”), then (i) you are agreeing to the Agreement on
					behalf of yourself and such Entity, (ii) you represent and warranty
					that you have the legal authority to bind such Entity to the Agreement
					and (iii) references to “you” and “your” in these Supplemental Terms
					will refer to both the individual using the Service and to any such
					Entity.
				</li>
				<li>
					As part of your use of the Service, and subject to the terms of the
					Agreement, you may create virtual gardens (“Gardens”). You own any
					Gardens that you create through your use of the Service (but, for
					clarity, ownership of any software, tools, information, content or
					other materials provided or made available to you pursuant to the
					Services shall remain with Meta and/or its licensors). To the fullest
					extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby grant to Meta and its
					affiliates a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, sublicensable
					(through multiple tiers), royalty-free license to reproduce,
					distribute, perform and display (publicly or otherwise), modify,
					create derivative works of, host and otherwise use the Gardens in
					connection with the Service, including any promotion thereof.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you submit to Meta any comments, questions, suggestions, use cases
					(whether actual or proposed), problems, issues, ideas, plans,
					materials (other than your Gardens), results, or other feedback
					relating to your use of the Service (“Feedback”), you hereby agree
					that Meta may, in its sole discretion, freely use and otherwise
					exploit such Feedback in connection with the Service and any of Meta’s
					other products or services or those of any of Meta’s affiliates or
					business partners, without any obligation, compensation or credit to
					you for providing such Feedback.
				</li>
				<li>
					In connection with your use of the Service, you agree not to create or
					make available any content (including any Garden), nor to provide any
					Feedback, that (a) infringes, misappropriates or violates the
					intellectual property rights or other rights of others or (b) might be
					regarded as offensive or harmful or contain vulgar language, slurs or
					culturally insensitive comments. Further, in using the Service, you
					agree to comply with Facebook’s Community Standards (available at
					<a
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/"
						>https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/</a
					>) (as may be updated from time to time), which are hereby
					incorporated by reference.
				</li>
				<li>
					To access and use the Service, you may be required to register for an
					account. By creating an account, you agree to: (i) provide accurate,
					current and complete account information; (ii) maintain the security
					of your password, not share your password with any other person and
					accept all risks of unauthorized access to your account; and (iii)
					promptly provide notice at
					<a
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/"
						>https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/</a
					>
					if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to
					the Service.
				</li>
				<li>
					Meta reserves the right (but has no obligation) to review, analyze and
					evaluate any content or other materials created using the Service
					(including any Garden), and to investigate or take appropriate action
					against you in Meta’s sole discretion if Meta believes that your use
					of the Service clearly, materially, or repeatedly violates either the
					Terms of Service or these Supplemental Terms. Such action may include
					terminating your account. Meta further reserves the right, at any
					time, to modify, suspend, or discontinue, in whole or in part, all or
					any elements of the Service and/or Software (as defined below),
					including any feature or functionality thereof, with or without notice
					to you. You agree that Meta will not be liable to you or to any third
					party for any such modification, suspension, or discontinuation.
				</li>
				<li>
					In connection with the Service, Meta makes available [insert name of
					Meta software] (the “Software”), including the source code for such
					Software, at [insert url for where the Software can be found]; subject
					to your compliance with the Terms of Service and these Supplemental
					Terms, the Software is licensed by Meta to you pursuant to the MIT
					License (available at
					<a
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"
						>https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</a
					>).
				</li>
				<li>
					You may not use any Meta trademarks or other Meta-related branding
					materials (“Meta Marks”), including in connection with any content or
					other materials created using the Service (including any Garden),
					unless Meta gives you express written permission to do so, and, in
					such case, solely as permitted by Meta and only for so long as Meta so
					permits. If you receive such express written permission from Meta, you
					agree to comply with Meta’s Brand Usage Guidelines (available at
					<a
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
						href="https://www.facebook.com/brand/resources/meta/company-brand"
						>https://www.facebook.com/brand/resources/meta/company-brand</a
					>) (as may be updated from time to time), which is hereby incorporated
					by reference, and you will not use any Meta Mark in any matter that is
					likely to cause confusion or dilute, blur or tarnish such Meta Mark or
					suggest that Meta endorses you, your products or services. You hereby
					agree that any and all goodwill generated by any use of any Meta Mark
					will inure to the benefit of Meta and/or its affiliates.

						>The Service is provided for entertainment purposes only. To the
						fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Meta makes no
						representations or warranties of any kind as to the adequacy,
						accuracy, currency or completeness of the Service, any Gardens or
						any other information made available through the Service. To the
						fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Meta is not liable for
						any decisions that you may make, or any actions that you take or
						fail to take, in reliance on the Service. You are solely responsible
						for your Gardens, and your use of the Service and any Gardens is at
						your own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
						the Service is provided “AS IS” without warranties of any kind,
						either express or implied, including without limitation warranties
						of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
						non-infringement or other violation of rights. To the fullest extent
						permitted by applicable law, Meta expressly disclaims any liability
						for any errors or omissions in the Service or Gardens. Meta does not
						control or direct what users do or say, and Meta is not responsible
						for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any
						content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene,
						unlawful and other objectionable content). Some jurisdictions may
						not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above
						exclusions may not apply to you.</strong

				</li>
				<li>
					<strong
						>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will
						Meta or its affiliates, or its or their respective directors,
						officers, employees, agents and assigns, be liable for any indirect,
						special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages, lost profits
						or other non-direct damages whatsoever arising in connection with
						the use of the Service or Gardens, even if one or more of them has
						been advised of the possibility of such damages or loss. Without
						limiting the foregoing, and to the fullest extent permitted by
						applicable law, the maximum aggregate liability for Meta or its
						affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers,
						employees, agents and assigns, for all damages, losses and causes of
						action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or
						otherwise, shall be fifty dollars ($50).</strong

				</li>
				<li>
					You will comply with all applicable export control laws of the United
					States and any other applicable governmental authority, including
					without limitation, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations
					("Export Laws"). You will not, directly or indirectly, export,
					re-export or download the Services (or any component thereof) or any
					Garden: (a) to any individual, entity or country prohibited by Export
					Laws, including by any U.S. sanctions program; (b) to anyone on the
					SDN List, the Denied Persons List or Entity List or other export
					control lists; or (c) for any purpose prohibited by Export Laws. You
					further represent and warrant that no U.S. federal agency has
					suspended, revoked or denied your export privileges and you are not
					listed on the SDN List.
				</li>
				<li>
					Sections 13(a) and 13(b) below apply to any claim, cause of action or
					dispute between you and Meta that arises out of or relates to these
					Supplemental Terms or your use of the Service (“Claim”).
				</li>
				<ol class="sublist">
					<li>a. If You reside in the United States:</li>
					<ol class="sublist">
						<li>
							i. You agree to arbitrate any Claims between you and Meta. This
							provision does not cover any claims relating to violations of your
							or our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited
							to, copyright infringement, patent infringement, trademark
							infringement, violations of the Brand Usage Guidelines, violations
							of your or Meta’s confidential information or trade secrets or
							efforts to interfere with the Service in unauthorized ways. If a
							Claim is not subject to arbitration, you agree that the claim must
							be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the
							Northern District of California or a state court located in San
							Mateo County, and that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of
							either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such
							claim.
						</li>
						<li>
							ii. Meta and you agree that, by entering into this arbitration
							provision, all parties are waiving their respective rights to a
							trial by jury or to participate in a class or representative
							action. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
							OTHER ONLY IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR
							CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE
							ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. You may bring a Claim only on your
							own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other parties.
							If there is a final judicial determination that any particular
							Claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated
							according to the limitations of this Section, then only that Claim
							(or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All
							other Claims (or requests for relief) will remain subject to this
							Section. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation
							and enforcement of this arbitration provision. All issues are for
							an arbitrator to decide, except that only a court may decide
							issues relating to the scope or enforceability of this arbitration
							provision or the interpretation of the prohibition of class and
							representative actions. If any party intends to seek arbitration
							of a dispute, that party must provide the other party with notice
							in writing. This notice of dispute to Meta must be sent to the
							following address: Meta Platforms, Inc. 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo
							Park, CA 94025. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s
							Commercial Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), as modified by these
							Supplemental Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. If the
							AAA is unavailable, the parties will agree to another arbitration
							provider or the court will appoint a substitute. The arbitrator
							will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations in which you
							are not a party. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable
							law, any evidentiary submissions made in arbitration will be
							maintained as confidential in the absence of good cause for its
							disclosure. The arbitrator’s award will be maintained as
							confidential only to the extent necessary to protect either
							party’s trade secrets or proprietary business information or to
							comply with a legal requirement mandating confidentiality. Each
							party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing,
							administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA Rules,
							except that Meta will pay for your filing, administrative and
							arbitrator fees if your Commercial Claim for damages does not
							exceed USD $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the
							standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If
							you do not wish to be bound by this provision (including its
							waiver of class and representative claims), you must notify Meta
							as set forth below within 30 days of the first acceptance date of
							any version of these Supplemental Terms containing an arbitration
							provision (for clarity, the date on which you first use the
							Service pursuant to these Supplemental Terms will constitute such
							acceptance date). Such notice to Meta must be submitted to the
							address here: Meta Platforms, Inc., 1601 Willow Rd. Menlo Park, CA
							94025. All Claims, whether subject to arbitration or not, will be
							governed by California law, excluding California’s conflict of
							laws rules, except to the extent that California law is contrary
							to or preempted by U.S. federal law.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>b. If you reside outside the United States, you agree that:</li>
					<ol class="sublist">
						<li>
							i. Any Claim between you and Meta must be resolved exclusively in
							the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or
							a state court located in San Mateo County, that you submit to the
							personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of
							litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of
							California will govern these Supplemental Terms and any such
							claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
						</li>
						<li>
							ii. Any Claim between you and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited must
							be resolved exclusively in the courts of the Republic of Ireland,
							that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of the Republic of
							Ireland for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and the laws
							of the Republic of Ireland will govern these Supplemental Terms
							and any such claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
						</li>
						<li>
							iii. Notwithstanding (i) and (ii) above, any Claim between you and
							both Meta and Meta Platforms Ireland Limited must be resolved
							exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
							of California or a state court located in San Mateo County, that
							you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts
							for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of
							the State of California will govern these Supplemental Terms and
							any such claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
						</li>
						<li>
							iv. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in Meta’s
							sole discretion, Meta may also bring any Claim Meta has against
							you in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over
							the Claim.
						</li>
					</ol>
					<li>
						c. If any provision of this Section 13 is found unenforceable, that
						provision will be severed and the balance of this Section 13 will
						remain in full force and effect.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<li>
					These Supplemental Terms are effective until terminated. Meta reserves
					the right to terminate your right to access and use the Service if you
					clearly, materially, or repeatedly violate these Supplemental Terms or
					any other terms or policies referenced herein, or if you otherwise
					create risk or possible legal exposure for Meta. Upon termination,
					these Supplemental Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you
					and Meta, but the provisions in Sections 1, 2, 3, 4 7, and 9-14 of
					these Supplemental Terms will survive and remain in place.
